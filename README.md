### Final project:

- The historical data for the past eight years from Zillow has been used to forecast the median listing price per SqFt of houses for the next few years. 
- As part of this research idea, a hybrid method that combines the time series model ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) has been proposed to make better predictions as compared to the predictions from individual ARIMA and ANN models. 
- Experiments on some real datasets has proven that this hybrid model takes in the strength of both ARIMA and ANN models in terms of dealing with linearity and non-linearity in data respectively and gives a combined model that is effective in improving the forecasting accuracy.
